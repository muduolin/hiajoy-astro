## Be a plant

Plants have magnificent ways to survive. They eat, sleep, bask in the sun and grow. Imagine yourself be a tree, you only need to focus on eating healthy food, getting enough sleep, and soaking up 10 minutes of sunshine. let yourself grow slowly.  Nothing else. 

### 1.  Stay Rooted
Like a plant, you don’t run from storms—you bend, you sway, but your roots hold firm. Breathe deep (photosynthesis helps). Feel your connection to the earth.

### 2.  Soak Up the Right Energy
Plants don’t waste time on toxic soil—they grow toward the light. Turn toward what nourishes you: fresh air, gentle music, a quiet moment.

### 3.  Grow at Your Own Pace
A sprout doesn’t panic because it’s not a tree yet. You’re allowed to take time. Growth isn’t a race.

### 4.  Release What You Don’t Need
Plants shed old leaves. Let go of worries like autumn leaves—they don’t define you.

### 5.  Trust the Process
Even in winter, roots are working underground. Anxiety is a season, not your forever state. You’re still growing, even when you can’t see it.

## Be an animal

Accept the desires, the needs, the anger, the competition. Reveal the true you like an animal. 

Great idea! When anxiety hits, embodying an animal can help ground you through movement, sound, or symbolic traits. Here are a few playful (but therapeutic) ways to "be an animal" when anxious:

### 1. **Turtle Retreat**  
   - *What to do*: Pull your shoulders up toward your ears (like a turtle tucking into its shell), take 3 slow breaths, then "peek out" by lowering your shoulders.  
   - *Why*: Mimics the safety of hiding and re-emerging when ready.

### 2. **Shake Like a Dog**  
   - *What to do*: Stand and shake your whole body—arms, legs, torso—as if you’re a dog shaking off water.  
   - *Why*: Releases tension and resets your nervous system.

### 3. **Lion’s Roar Breath**  
   - *What to do*: Inhale deeply, then exhale with a loud "HA!" (stick out your tongue like a lion if you’re feeling bold).  
   - *Why*: Releases pent-up energy and activates the diaphragm.

### 4. **Sloth Slow-Mo**  
   - *What to do*: Move in exaggerated slow motion for 30 seconds (e.g., reaching for a cup like a sloth).  
   - *Why*: Slows racing thoughts by syncing your body and mind.

### 5. **Bird Wing Stretch**  
   - *What to do*: Spread your arms wide like wings, stretch upward, then gently "flap" them 3-4 times.  
   - *Why*: Opens the chest (where anxiety often hides) and encourages deep breaths.

### 6. **Fox Ears**  
   - *What to do*: Cup your hands behind your ears and "listen like a fox" to 3 sounds around you.  
   - *Why*: Shifts focus outward, interrupting anxious thought loops.

**Bonus**: If you’re somewhere private, crawl like a bear or crab-walk to engage your whole body—it’s hard to stay anxious when you’re being silly!  

Animals live in the moment—by copying them, we can borrow their instinctual calm. Which one feels right for you? 🐾

## Be a child

You can build up your world again. Use your curiosity, your passion and courage. Even if it is naive, silly.
When you're feeling anxious, it can help to reconnect with the playful, carefree spirit of childhood. Here’s how to "be a child" again to ease your worries:  

### **1. Let Yourself Imagine**  
- Pretend you’re in your favorite story or movie.  
- Draw silly pictures (even if they’re just scribbles!).  
- Build a fort with blankets and pillows—your own safe little world.  

### **2. Move Like a Kid**  
- Jump, dance, or spin around—shake out the nervous energy.  
- Play with toys (fidget spinners, slime, or Legos work great!).  
- Go outside and run, swing, or just lie in the grass watching clouds.  

### **3. Talk to Yourself Like a Kind Friend**  
- If a little kid told you they were scared, what would you say? Say that to yourself.  
- Give yourself a hug or hold your favorite stuffed animal.  
- Whisper, "It’s okay to feel this way. I’m safe right now."  

### **4. Focus on Tiny, Happy Things**  
- Blow bubbles and watch them float.  
- Eat a snack slowly, noticing the taste (like a kid tasting candy for the first time).  
- Listen to a silly song or watch a funny cartoon.  

### **5. Ask for Help Like a Child Would**  
- If you’re overwhelmed, say it out loud: *"I need a hug"* or *"Can you stay with me?"*  
- Hold someone’s hand (even if it’s just squeezing a stress ball).  
- Remember: Even grown-ups sometimes need to cry or be comforted—that’s okay.  

Anxiety makes us feel like we have to "figure everything out," but being a child again means letting go, trusting that you’re cared for, and finding joy in small moments. 💛  

Do not be afraid of starting over, no matter how old, how battered you are now. There is a change to start over, to rebuild a better you.
